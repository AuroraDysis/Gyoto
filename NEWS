1.1.3 2016/12/13 BUG
   This is a backport release of ABI-compatible fixes of 1.2.0 to
   the 1.1.X branch.
   * Correctly handle empty stry case in OscilTorus::emittingArea();
   * Support enroling MPI_COMM_WORLD in python/example-mpi.py;
   * Add --version option to gyoto command-line tool.

1.1.2 2016/12/10 FTR
   * New Metrics in stdplug: ChernSimons, RezzollaZhidenko.
   * New Astrobjs in stdplug: DeformedTorus, DynamicalDiskBolometric,
     EquatorialHotSpot, InflateStar, OscilTorus.
   * Allow specifying plug-in by file name.
   * Support colon syntax of mpirun (bypassing MPI_Comm_spawn()).
   * Support mpirun -np option for Open MPI (bypassing
     MPI_Comm_spawn()).

1.1.1 2016/10/30 BUG
   * When Gyoto is configured to be installed in another prefix than
     /usr/local/, look into two additional directories when loading
     plug-ins: /usr/local/lib/gyoto/<sovers>/ and
     /usr/local/lib/gyoto/.
   * The name of the versioned directories for plug-ins (<sovers>
     above) is now the major version of the library, so users don't
     need to reinstall there plug-ins when ugrading Gyoto to a
     binary-compatible release.
   * --enable-hardening now also enables -fPIE.
   * Yorick: actually implement `picture' painter for the matte_paint
     framework. Allow using any two or three-dimensional image or
     stack of images in the `picture' and `panorama' painters.
   * Include minimal plug-in example in plugins/null/.

1.1.0 2016/09/12 ABI 4 (5:0:0)
   * New functionality: provide a plug-in for writing new Metrics,
     Astrobjs and Spectra in Python.
   * New functionality: objects can describe there own
     properties. This feature is accessible through the help() method
     in the Python and Yorick interfaces and through -h on the
     command-line: "gyoto -hMetric::KerrBL"
   * New functionality: adding a flag to highligh the shadow region in
     a strong-field image
   * Various improvements and bug fixes in the Python extension.
   * Yorick: Add more functions to control the floating-point
     environment from Yorick.
   * Screen: properly parse "Mask" as a filename
   * KerrKS: remove specific integrator, which has never worked well.
   * PowerLawSpectrum: add cut-offs.
   * DirectionalDisk: add cutoff in lamp/disk frames.
   * PolishDoughnut: add central_temperature_ parameter.

1.0.2 2015/06/26 BUG
   * Fix FTBFS with gcc 5.0;
   * Improve fenv support and lack thereof with some compilers;
   * Distinguish size_t from unsigned long in Gyoto::Value;
   * Rewrite option parsing in `gyoto' command line utility, add many
     options: short options, -i/-j, -E, -X... see manpage and
     $ gyoto --help
   * Fix many compile-time warnings, including potentially harmfull
     undefined behavior;
   * KerrKS is not work-in-progress anymore, but it's specific
     integrator is known to be buggy (and issues a severe warning when
     used).
   * Several small bug-fixes, see ChangeLog for details.

1.0.1 2015/05/27 PKG
   * Add 3rd clause of BSD license to python/doxy2swig.py;
   * Add Odele to AUTHORS;
   * Bugfixes in configure.ac: use BOOST_*_LIBS variables instead of
     hardcoding one possible value, make it possible to build when
     python is installed but with an unsupported version.

1.0.0 2015/05/25 ABI 3
   * New functionality: MPI-based parallelisation.
   * New functionality: Python extension.
   * New functionality: most classes now derive from Gyoto::Object and
     have "Properties" (instances of Gyoto::Property). This provides
     for some introspection which is used notably in the Yorick
     plug-in and simplifies writing new derived classes.
   * Change Scenery::rayTrace() API, replacing i/jmin and max with a
     new concept Screen::Coord2dSet. This allows using the same
     code-path for both the gyoto utility and all the yorick use cases.
   * Update PolishDoughnut to support numerical (non-Kerr) metrics.
   * New spectrum: Gyoto::Spectrum::ThermalBremsstrahlung.
   * The usual lot of bug fixes and enhancements.

0.2.3 2014/10/21 BUG
	* Fix minor memory management bug in yotck/gyoto_Scenery.C

0.2.2 2014/09/19 BUG
	* Correct Metric:: and KerrBL::circularVelocity().

0.2.1 2014/07/22 ABI 2.1
	* ABI is backward compatible with 0.2.0.
	* Support for the special values DBL_MAX, DBL_MIN, -DBL_MAX
          and -DBL_MIN is any scalar floating-point value in XML i/o.
          This avoids loss of precission or SGFPE when
          saving/restoring certain default value in XML files.
	* Bug fix: avoid buffer overflow in Factory.

0.2.0 2014/07/21 ABI 2
	* New integrators, require Boost >= 1.93 and C++11. The new
	  integrators live in Worldline::IntegState, not in the Metric. Read
	  the user guide for more details, as well as the doxygen
	  documentation for the Scenery class.
	* New Metrics: Minkowski, NumericalMetricLorene
	* New Astrobjs: DirectionalDisk, StarTrace, ThinDiskIronLine
	* Give access to some numerical parameters of the RK4 integrator
	* Include LaTeX user guide
	* Yorick plug-in API change: the dot operator has changed its meaning.
	  Codes that used it may require updating. Examples:
	    m = gg.mass -> m =gg.mass()
	    obj=gg.clone -> obj=gg.clone()
	    scenery.screen(resolution=128) -> screnery.screen.resolution(128)
	    scenery.astrobj(initcoord=x,v) -> scenery.astrobj()(initcoord=x,v)
	* Rename methods from from setMass()/getMass() style to mass()/mass()
	  style. Macro with the old names are provided in GyotoDefs.h,
	  triggering a deprecation warning. Code may break nevertheless,
	  typically in two cases:
	    + if the new name was used as a variable name in your code:
	      please change the variable name;
	    + if your derived class overloaded only one of the two accessors
	      (e.g. only setMetric, not getMetric): in this example add
	        using Generic::metric;
	      in your derived class definition.
	  To get rid of the deprecation warning, define the GYOTO_NO_DEPRECATED
	  macro, for instance "make CPPFLAGS=-DGYOTO_NO_DEPRECATED"
	* Serious bug fixes and improvements in PolishDoughnut
	* Replaced Disk3D_BB with DynamicalDisk3D
	* Disk3D now has an opacity
	* Make KerrKS work (using the generic integrator only)
	* New interface: work in progress (WIP), to mark classes that are known
	  to be broken. Instanciating such a class yields a warning.
	* Update build systems to current autotools
        * Implement mask in screen to compute only parts of an image
	* Improve behaviour for emitter or observer far from massive object

0.1.0 2013/07/27 ABI 1
	* add units system
	* add PolishDoughnut astrobj
	* use pkg-config
	* gyotoy ported to yorick-gy instead of python
	* in Worldline, Photon and Scenery: rename tlim to tmin, default
	  value is -DBL_MAX.
	* add a mutli-wavelength flavour of Astrobj::emission()
	* install yorick plug-in under ${prefix}, not necessarily in Y_HOME
	* add plugin attribute to the Metric, Astrobj and Spectrum entities
	* reform build system to use the autotools
	* add --plugins command-line option
	* add virtual destrcuctor to Spectrum::Generic
	* fix buffer overflow in lib/Factory.C
	* update paper ref in bin/gyoto.C

0.0.3 2012/05/01 BUG
	* fix a tiny bug in PatternDisk (initialization of phimin/max)
	* rearrange flags in Makefiles/local_settings
	  for easier downstream packaging

0.0.2 2012/04/19 PKG
	* install include files in include/Gyoto
	* add this ChangeLog

0.0.1 2012/04/16 ABI 0
	* release
